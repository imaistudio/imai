current tasks: 

1. ✅ FIXED - MOBILE HORIZONTAL SCROLL BUG: Moved UnifiedPromptContainer to same rendering context as WelcomeScreen
   - WelcomeScreen: ✅ Horizontal scroll works  
   - ChatWindow: ✅ Horizontal scroll now works
   - Root cause: UnifiedPromptContainer was in mobile-input-area (constrained) vs mobile-chat-area (free)
   - Solution: Moved ChatWindow's UnifiedPromptContainer into mobile-chat-area context in page.tsx
2. ✅ FIXED - VIDEO SIZE MATCHING IMAGE SIZE: Removed w-96 wrapper div from videos
   - Problem: Videos had extra w-96 wrapper (384px width) while images used w-auto h-36 
   - Solution: Removed wrapper div, now both use same className "w-auto h-36 md:h-96 object-cover rounded-lg"
   - Result: Videos and images now have consistent sizing on mobile and desktop
