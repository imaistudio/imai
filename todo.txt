current tasks: 

1. ✅ FIXED - MOBILE HORIZONTAL SCROLL BUG: Moved UnifiedPromptContainer to same rendering context as WelcomeScreen
   - WelcomeScreen: ✅ Horizontal scroll works  
   - ChatWindow: ✅ Horizontal scroll now works
   - Root cause: UnifiedPromptContainer was in mobile-input-area (constrained) vs mobile-chat-area (free)
   - Solution: Moved ChatWindow's UnifiedPromptContainer into mobile-chat-area context in page.tsx
2. Stripe Payment Gateway with credits systems 
3. to be continued.
